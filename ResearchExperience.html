							<h2>War of Attrition</h2><br />
							<p>I model a generalized war-of-attrition game to investigate the influence of asymmetry on social conflicts. This model is the first one that combines ex-ante asymmetry, multiple players, and incomplete information. I study both behavioral and welfare insights, and it is shown that they are strikingly different from those brought by the modeling of either symmetric or two-player war of attrition. For a closer look at my results, please see this <a href="ResearchOngoing.html">link</a> and thus I omit the summary of them here.</p>
							<p>This study began in September 2018 and I have spent at least 500 hours on it. Professor <a href="http://nsd.pku.edu.cn/szdw/qzjs/w/262179.htm">Hao Wang</a> has been giving me instructions since the beginning, and later during the summer of 2019, I also started to receive suggestions from Professor <a href="http://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/jsjjxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1141&user_id=wengxi125">Xi Weng</a>. Moreover, I have been making contact with international scholars potentially interested in this study and the comments I have received so far are mainly positive. During this project, I make myself quite acquaintant with the literature of all forms of conflicts, like war of attrition, bargaining, contest, auction, etc., and further I differentiate my work from them in both technical and intuitive aspects.</p>
							<p>Although the literature of war of attrition has a 40-year history, it still generates interest. Actually, right in September 2019, one of the leading journals of economic theory, <a href="https://econtheory.org/">Theoretical Economics</a>, published a paper (<a href="https://econtheory.org/ojs/index.php/te/article/viewFile/3158/24484/709">Kambe (2019)</a>) which studies a similar yet simplified version of my model. However, our setups are different enough to capture different insights, and our motivations clearly differ from each other as well. First, Kambe (2019) simplifies the problem by considering two-type incomplete information in which one of the two types is non-compromising, and this indicates that his model is essentially a perturbed complete-information game. In contrast, I study a model with continuous-type incomplete information which requires more complex techniques to analyze, and the infinite-dimension nature of the information structure brings more variation to the analysis which cannot appear in the two-type model. Second, Kambe (2019) focuses mainly on the analysis of equilibrium behavior, that is, who is likely to exit and when the war of attrition ends quickly. Nonetheless, my analysis shows that this focus should be attached with less importance as there are examples where the outcome or, equivalently, the welfare level is irrelevant to some variation of players' behavior. Namely, I show that it is something else, but not necessarily players' exact provision time, that determines the outcome. With these two points, I go further than Kambe (2019).</p>
							<p>This study triggers some future interests. The first lies in making redistribution a cheap resolution to the delay problem occurring in wars of attrition. In the concluding part, I mention that by combining the advantages of both centralization and decentralization, redistribution can do better than central provision. Additionally, I suggest to look into the transformation process from war of attrition to a more cooperative institution, and I anticipate that the presence of the war-of-attrition benchmark may obstruct this process and that asymmetry can make it even worse.</p>
