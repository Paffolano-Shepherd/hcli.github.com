								<h2>About National School of Development</h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">National School of Development at Peking University (NSD) was formerly known as the China Center of Economic Research (CCER). Founded by Justin Yifu Lin and five Chinese economists who came back from overseas in 1994, the center has been dedicated to promoting the comprehensive and interdisciplinary education of social sciences, to advancing theoretical and policy research in China, and to serving the needs emerged from China’s reform. In 2015, the Center for New Structural Economics was established in NSD to lead theoretical research in international development and to support policy implementation by utilizing experiences from China and other developing countries. In 2016, the Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development was established to foster high-level talents to possess comprehensive theoretical knowledge, a broad international vision and open mindedness, and abilities to work for national development and to make decisions in light of national conditions for developing countries. NSD started admitting full-time undergraduate students in 2016.</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">NSD is run by faculty. The open-minded academic environment allows researchers to agree to disagree on academic topics. All faculty have oversea education backgrounds. Through relentless effort over the past twenty years, NSD has formed tailored education programs for students in the field of politics, business, and academics. It is a flagship institution in economics education and research in China. NSD is the first institution in China to establish a systematic modern economics education program that provides education for undergraduate double major in economics program and Master and PhD graduate programs. The undergraduate double major in economics program is the largest undergraduate program at Peking University. The graduate programs are small-sized and highly competitive. Graduate program alumni are well received in both academic institutions and the industry in China and internationally.<br />The co-founder Professor Justin Yifu Lin is the first Chief Economist of World Bank from a developing country.</p>
